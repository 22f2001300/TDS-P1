## Analysis

-   I used chatGPT to generate python code and used google colab to fetch data. And used github access token for api request.
-   JavaScript is the most popular language among these users and also the second most popular among the users who joined after 2020.
-   Actionable recommendation for developers is Learn and Master the JavaScript language.
